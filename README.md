# The Common Descent Podcast Stuff

## Chronological listening order

I love the Common Descent podcast. But rather than just listening from episode 1 to whatever-the-current-episode-number-is, I'd like to listen to it chronologically. i.e. from the start of the universe (or whatever the closest to that is) up to today. I know I can't fit every episode into this timeline (as discussed on the Discord) but I can at least build a skeleton that others can flesh out.

## Q+A

### This is wrong/incomplete!

This is still a work in progress. Want to help? Look below for how.

### Can I contribute?

You sure can! I'd love some help here. If you know how to GitHub, make a pull request. If you don't know how to GitHub, look up Firefly Blue on the Discord and drop me a line.

### Can I copy this into a Google doc? That seems like a better way to do this kind of thing

Sure! I'm a software dev and more used to GitHub for pretty much everything. But I'd prefer a way that everyone can take part. So go for it!

### Why the emojis?

Cuz it's nice to be able to categorize things into "mass extinctions", etc
